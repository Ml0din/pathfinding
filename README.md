Project Purpose

The project involves developing a pathfinding algorithm in Java based on the concept of reinforcement learning. This algorithm is designed to find paths in a two-dimensional plane and has been tested in the game Minecraft, but it is generalizable to any situation that supports an x-z coordinate system.

The primary goal of this project is to create an intelligent and adaptive pathfinding solution that can be applied in various environments. Specifically, the project aims to:

Implement Reinforcement Learning Techniques: Utilize reinforcement learning principles to enable the algorithm to learn and adapt to different obstacles in the environment.

Optimize Pathfinding Efficiency: Develop an algorithm that can efficiently find the shortest or most optimal path in complex environments, reducing computational time and resource usage.

Generalize for Multiple Applications: Ensure the algorithm is flexible and can be applied to any scenario involving a two-dimensional coordinate system (x, z), making it useful for a wide range of applications beyond gaming.

Key Features:

Dynamic Environment Handling: Capable of adjusting to changes in the environment, ensuring robust and reliable pathfinding.

Efficient Path Calculation: Optimized to quickly determine the best path, even in complex and obstacle-rich terrains.

Versatile Application: Suitable for various use cases, from gaming environments like Minecraft to real-world applications involving x-z coordinate systems.
